            <h2>Rajahni Cunningham</h2>
            <p>I am a Computer Science major who enjoys conversations surrounding technology.
                I enjoy the idea of Web Development as I see it being an integral part of my experience
                as a person interested in computing. The assets and experience gained by being able to design
                appealing websites will forever be a relevant in my interest of study. This is only
                the first step in my journey.
                My major hobby is listening to music of all genres, my goal is to incorporate musical experience into
                a website some day.
